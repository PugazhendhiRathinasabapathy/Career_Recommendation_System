## Project Overview

The **Career Recommendation System** is an AI-powered web application designed to assist individuals in making informed career decisions. By leveraging **Large Language Models (LLM)**, the system generates personalized career suggestions based on a series of questions related to the user’s interests, skills, and preferences. It dynamically adapts its questions based on the user’s answers, offering a tailored experience that helps users discover the best-fit career options.

This system utilizes advanced AI techniques and is especially useful for students, professionals, or anyone looking to explore potential career opportunities.
## Features

- **Personalized Career Recommendations**: Uses LLM to process user input and suggest the top three career paths tailored to the user's skills and interests.
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: The system adapts and asks personalized questions based on previous responses using LLM.
- **Detailed Career Insights**: Career recommendations come with a comprehensive job description, potential salary range, and other relevant data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An interactive UI makes the experience smooth and intuitive for users.
- **AI-Powered**: The system uses **LLaMA** (a state-of-the-art language model) for natural language processing to generate career-related questions and recommendations.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: The user answers a series of questions about their skills, interests, and preferences.
2. **Dynamic Question Generation**: Using **LLaMA**, the system generates relevant follow-up questions based on the answers provided.
3. **Career Recommendations**: The system analyzes the responses using **LLM** to suggest the top three career options.
4. **Detailed Career Profiles**: The system fetches career-related data (e.g., job descriptions, salary ranges) dynamically using web scraping.
